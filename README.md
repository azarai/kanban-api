A Kanban Backend for the Kanban backend project.

## Kanban-Backend Project
The Kanban-Backend was inspired by the Todo-Backend and takes it a step further. It provides a backend for a simple Kanban API with multiiple users, multiple boards per user, user registration and login via API and token authentication via header.

## Default implementation using Spring Boot and Java 8

A full working Kanban backend as an API. It is a tutorial I run in my [API-Series newsletter](http://codeboje.de/tag/api-series/).
